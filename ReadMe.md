# Creating vocabulary exercises
This project is a project to revisit something that I created before with less experience. It is certainly rough in various aspects still as I test things and start to figure out how I really want this project to work (yes, my portfolio could use a more polished project that I can add to it).

This project is incomplete and is mainly focused on having a program that can handle (1) getting good vocabulary word choices from a song and (2) some words that are more related to those vocabulary words and some that are less related to them. A new commit should be coming in not too long improving various aspects of this current commit.
