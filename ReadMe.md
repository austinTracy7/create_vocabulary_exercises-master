# Creating vocabulary exercises
This project is a project to revisit something that I created before with less experience. It is certainly rough in various aspects still as I test things and start to figure out how I really want this project to work (yes, my portfolio could use a more polished project that's sharableâ€”I should make that happen).

This project is incomplete and is mainly focused on having a program that can handle (1) getting good vocabulary word choices from a song and (2) some words that are more related to those vocabulary words and some that are less related to them. A new commit should be coming in not too long improving various aspects of this current commit.

This like the original would be able to be used for building an ESL class activity. The words would then be presented either in a slideshow (with pictures added) or in a Kahoot game.
